.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR _printf ()
produce output according to a
.I format
as described below.
The function
.BR _printf ()
write output to
.IR stdout ,
the standard output stream;
This function write the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via  the  variable-length argument facilities of
.BR stdarg(3))
are converted for output.
.SS Field width
An optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) specifying
a minimum field width.
If the converted value has fewer characters
than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on the left
(or right, if the left-adjustment flag has been given).
Instead of a decimal digit string one may write "*" or "*m$"
(for some decimal integer \fIm\fP) to specify that the field width
is given in the next argument, or in the \fIm\fP-th argument, respectively,
which must be of type
.IR int .
A negative field width is taken as a \(aq\-\(aq flag followed by a
positive field width.
In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a
field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the
field is expanded to contain the conversion result.
.SS Precision
An optional precision, in the form of a period (\(aq.\(aq)  followed by an
optional decimal digit string.
Instead of a decimal digit string one may write "*" or "*m$"
(for some decimal integer \fIm\fP) to specify that the precision
is given in the next argument, or in the \fIm\fP-th argument, respectively,
which must be of type
.IR int .
If the precision is given as just \(aq.\(aq, the precision is taken to
be zero.
A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted.
This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
.BR d
and
.BR i
conversions, the number of digits to appear after the radix character and to be printed from a string for
.B s
conversions.
